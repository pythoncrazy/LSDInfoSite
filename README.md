I am using django, with python==3.10
The requirements are listed in requirements.txt, so you can activate the venv, or use the requirements.txt to install the development version.
I'm using this on wsl, just because I'm quirky like that.(last part was a joke, I am using WSL however) 

I like WSL because I can use linux, while mainting windows because chess software requires that I use windows :( Chessbase needs to make a linux compatible version one day.
