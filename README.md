 This is the official source code of the LSD Information Website
I am using Django, with python==3.10
The requirements are listed in requirements.txt, so you can use the requirements.txt to install the development version.
I'm using this on wsl, just because I'm quirky like that.(last part was a joke, I am using WSL however) 

I like WSL because I can use Linux, while maintaining windows because chess software requires that I use windows :( Chessbase needs to make a Linux compatible version one day.
