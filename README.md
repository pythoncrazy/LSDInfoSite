# LSDInfoSite
This is the official source code of the LSD Information Website
I am using Django, with python==3.8, since I massively prefer having a slightly outdated version in exchange for everything working!

The idea of the website is to allow for someone, like the SECRETARY OF LSD (I wish it was me...), could add information to the website, and allow for the information to be put on the website.


The requirements are listed in requirements.txt, so you can use the requirements.txt to install the development version.
I'm using this on wsl, just because I'm quirky like that.(last part was a joke, I am using WSL however) 

I like WSL because I can use Linux, while maintaining windows because chess software requires that I use windows :( Chessbase needs to make a Linux compatible version one day.

Python: 3.8

OS: Windows 11, with WSL2, which has Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

GitHub Desktop too, since it is cool.

Anaconda 2022.10, because I am not dealing with venv being bad and conflicting with the default python. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26053982/setup-script-exited-with-error-command-x86-64-linux-gnu-gcc-failed-with-exit, it is beyond bad)
